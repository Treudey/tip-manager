# Tip Manager

An app for those who work a job where they make tips to track their tips and have useful data presented to them in an intuitive manner. This is a fully functional website with complete secure authentication to store all tip data discreetly. Users can add tips, either one by one or several at a time by uplaoding a csv file. They can also download a csv file of their tips at any time. Users have their tip data summarized for them on a dashboard and can also view several charts that show their data sorted into different categories, so that they may see what days, months, types of shifts yield them the highest amounts.
